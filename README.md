#### Advanced Custom Fields

This theme requires Advanced Custom Fields Professional. Which if you don't have already, you should get.

Remove the contents of ```acf-json``` if you want to start from scratch.

#### General

The views folder is intended as a place to add content types for the theme.

It's been developed over the past 3 or so years with the intention to get up and running quickly with a Bootstrap 3+ based structure. A version of it has been used it in a great many enterprise level WordPress installations so it can be considered a (relatively) stable version 1.

I am releasing this as an open source theme set so feel free to iterate, clone, fork and debug it. Any extra features would also be great.
